# CSCE-312

Lab1: <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prob2: Simply shows the bytes size of different types.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prob3: Simulates a real control system for a vehicle.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prob4: A faster simulation of Prob3.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prob5: A speed test of the previous two programs.<br />
Lab2: <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prob1: A simple circuit.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prob2: Circuits in the 74XX series used: 74LS08, 74LS32, 74LS16. Using individual bits, wrote a circuit that will recieve a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;button press in a given car and signal which car it came from.<br />
Lab3: <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prob2: Wrote a toggle switch.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prob3: Wrote a curcuit that simulates the C code in Lab1.<br />
Lab4: <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prob1a: Wrote a coder/decoder.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prob1b: Wrote a circuit that simulates a car blinker.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prob3: Wrote a collection of circuits that preform math operations. <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Includes: Barrel shifter, adder, magnitude comparator, subtractor, multiplexer, and others. For both one bit and one byte &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operations.<br />
Lab5:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A collection of programs in y86 assembly language.<br />
Project:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simulated a real life microprocessor.<br />
